#Nginx as reverse proxy

## Docker 
The [.env](.env) file, is only used during a pre-processing step when working with [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)  files. Dollar-notation variables like $PROJECT_NAME are substituted for values contained in an “.env” named file in the same directory.


  
## Nginx 
Static configurations are in [nginx/nginx.conf](nginx/nginx.conf).
